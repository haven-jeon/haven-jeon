I'm the husband of a kind woman and a dad like a friend of good sons.

I am a software engineer from Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·. I like software development and value it in making what people need and can use comfortably.

I work at [SK Telecom](https://www.sktelecom.com/index_en.html) as a Research Engineer. For more information about me, check out [this](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gogamza/).
